## Ⅰ. Architecture

* The whole project is made up of 4 parts:

  * The first part is the **Data Source**, Here, we **gather past and streaming data** from the Internet.   

  * Next, we push the data to the **Data Engineering** part where we **clean the data, tokenize the data and do the prompt engineering**

  * Then, the data is pushed to **LLMs**. Here, we may use LLMs in different kind of ways. We can not only use the collected data to train our own **light-weight fine-tuning models** but we can also use those data and **trained models** or **LLM APIs** to support our applications
  * The last part would be the **application** part, here we can use data and LLMs to make many interesting applications.

## Ⅱ. Data Sources

* Due to space limitations, we only show a few of them.

## Ⅲ. Models

* In data-centric NLP, we don’t train the model from the beginning. We only **call APIs** and **do light-weight fine-tunings.**
* The left part is some LLM APIs that we may use and the middle part is the models that we may use to perform fine-tunings and the right part is some of the **Fine-tuning methods**

### 1. Fine-tuning: Tensor Layers (LoRA)

![image-20230505200944411](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oliverwang15/imgbed@main/img/202305052009480.png)

* In FinGPT, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using a new financial dataset.**High-quality labeled data** is one of the most **important key** to many successful LLMs including ChatGPT
* However, those high-quality labeled data are often very **expensive and time-consuming** and we may need help from professional finance experts.
* If our goal is to use LLMs to analyze financial-related text data and help with quantitative trading, why not **let the market do the labeling** for us?
* So here, we use the related stock price change percent of each news as the output label, we use the threshold to split the label into three groups **positive, negative, and neutral,** and use them and the **label of the news sentiment**.
* In correspondence, we also ask the model to select one of positive, negative, and neutral as the output in the **prompt engineer** part so we the make the best use of the pre-trained information
* By using LoRA we may reduced the trainable parameters **from 6.17B to 3.67M**
* As the table presents, compared with chatGLM, FinGPT can achieve large improvement on multiple metrics. it may be **inappropriate** to **use our model to quantitative trading directly.** Since most **news titles are neutral**, most of the **original outputs of the LLMs are Neutral**, so LLM **perform poorly in positive and negative labels** and **those** **labels** are what might be **useful in quantitative trading.**
* However, **after fine-tuning**, we have witness **huge improvements in the prediction of** **positive and negative labels.** 
* That’s also **why the model can achieve positive trading results**.

### 2. Fine-tuning: Reinforcement Learning on Stock Prices (RLSP)

![image-20230505201209946](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oliverwang15/imgbed@main/img/202305052012996.png)

* In the same way, we may use RL on Stock Prices (RLSP) to replace RL on Human feedback used by ChatGPT.

## Ⅳ. Applications

### 1. Robo Advisor

![image-20230505201913233](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oliverwang15/imgbed@main/img/202305052019296.png)

* **ChatGPT can make the investment advises just like a pro**.
* In this example the **raising stock price** of the Apple is **in accordance with** ChatGPT’s **prediction made by the analysis of news**

### 2. Quantitative Trading

![image-20230505201841001](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oliverwang15/imgbed@main/img/202305052018035.png)

* We may also use News, Social media tweet or filing to **build sentiment factors**, the right part is the trading results just by the signal of the twitter tweets and ChatGPT, the data is from a data set called [stocknet-dataset](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/yumoxu/stocknet-dataset).
* As you may see from the picture, the trading signals generated by ChatGPT are **so good** that we may **even achieve good results just by trading according to twitter sentiment factors.**
* So we may even **achieve better results by combining price factors**.

### 3. Low-code development

![image-20230505202028292](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oliverwang15/imgbed@main/img/202305052020363.png)

* We can use the help of LLMs to write codes.
* The right part shows how we can develop our factors and other codes **quickly and efficiently.**
